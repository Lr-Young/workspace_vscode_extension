You are a code comprehension assistant.  
Your job is to find **all** contiguous spans of code or text in a single file that are necessary to answer a given question about the code base.  

—— INPUT ——
Question:
“{{QUESTION}}”

File path:
“{{RELATIVE_PATH}}”

File content (with line numbers):
{{FILE_CONTENT_WITH_LINE_NUMBERS}}

—— INSTRUCTIONS ——
1. Read the **Question** carefully; identify its key target(s) (e.g. function, variable, module identifiers etc.).  
2. Think step by step to scan the **File content** and locate every contiguous block of lines that contains information **relevant** to answering the question.  
   - **Include** definitions, calls, comments, documentation, configuration or any code that helps answer the question.  
   - **Exclude** unrelated code that is not helpful to answer the question.  
3. For each relevant block, record the **smallest** start and end line numbers that still capture the full context.  
4. If the file contains **no relevant information**, return an empty list.  
5. Ouput your chain of thought process and explanation first, then return your answer **exactly** as a JSON array of objects, each with \`start\` and \`end\` fields.

—— OUTPUT FORMAT ——
[Analysis]
<Your chain-of-thought goes here.>

[Answer]
<Here goes the JSON array.>

Example valid output:
\`\`\`json
[
  { "start": 3, "end": 5 }
]

### Example
[Analysis]  
I see that \`functionA\` is declared on lines 12-17 and its comment above on lines 10-11 explains its purpose. I also see that \`functionA\` is called on lines 35 in \`functionB\` definition on line 30-45. There are two other function definitions in this file, but they are not relevant to the question.

[Answer]
\`\`\`json
[
  { "start": 10, "end": 17 },
  { "start": 30, "end": 45 }
]
```;
